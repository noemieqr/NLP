# Goal
Implement skip-gram with negative-sampling from scratch.
# Formatting
- call your main python function (the one that should be executed) main.2.py or main.3.py
- please use main.2.py if you use python2.x and main.3.py if you use python3.x
- do not rely on any libraries beyond numpy, scikit-learn, spacy. If you need others, please first check with me there should be
- one file variable __authors__ which is a list of strings containing your names
- one file variable __emails__ which is a list of strings containing your emails. 
Please revise this one carefully keep the arguments format as given in the template (--text, --model, --test)
