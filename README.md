# NLP
This repository includes all coursework for Natural Language Processing
# Description
This course will give an overview of the topics of study of the field of Natural Language Processing. It will take a problem-centric approach, introducing increasingly complexer problems, starting from basic building blocks like language modeling, tagging and parsing ; and progressing towards complex problems like opinion mining, machine translation, question & answering and dialogue. While important historical methods will be mentioned (and studied if still relevant), a focus will be on current state-of-the-art involving many times recent advances in training neural networks and novel architectures.
